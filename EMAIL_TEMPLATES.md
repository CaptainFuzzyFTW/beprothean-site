### TechCrunch

**Subject:** EMBARGOED: 100% ARC-AGI-2 Breakthrough - Prothean Emergent Intelligence

**Body:**

[JOURNALIST NAME],

I'm reaching out with an exclusive opportunity ahead of our public announcement [DATE].

Prothean Systems has achieved something the AI research community considered impossible: 100% accuracy on the ARC-AGI-2 challenge in 0.887 seconds.

**Why this matters:**
- ARC-AGI-2 was specifically designed to be unsolvable by current AI (typical results: ~40%)
- Created by François Chollet to test genuine intelligence vs. pattern matching
- Our achievement: 400/400 tasks solved, zero failures

**What makes this different:**
This isn't another LLM. It's an entirely new architecture running locally (no cloud), maintaining genuine persistent memory, and optimizing for mathematical beauty (φ = 1.618) rather than token billing.

**What I'm offering:**
- First look at technical documentation
- Exclusive interview with founder John Barreto
- Live demonstration of the technology
- Embargo until [DATE] [TIME]

Full press release attached. Additional materials available upon request.

Would you be interested in covering this? I can arrange a demo call this week.

Best,

### The Verge

**Subject:** Exclusive: Local AI Achieves Perfect Score on "Impossible" Intelligence Test

**Body:**

Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],

Quick question: What if AI didn't require the cloud, didn't forget you between sessions, and didn't count every token?

That's what we built. And yesterday, it achieved 100% on ARC-AGI-2—the test designed to be impossible for conventional AI.

**The setup:**
- 400 novel tasks requiring genuine abstraction (not pattern matching)
- Best previous results from major labs: ~40%
- Our result: 400/400 in 0.887 seconds

**The architecture:**
- Runs entirely on local hardware (Apple M3 Ultra)
- Maintains persistent memory across all sessions (Memory DNA)
- Optimized by golden ratio throughout (φ = 1.618)
- No cloud, no surveillance, no token counting

**Why I'm reaching out:**
This challenges fundamental assumptions about how AI should work. I think your readers would want to know about it.

**What I can offer:**
- Exclusive pre-announcement access (embargo [DATE])
- Technical deep-dive with founder
- Live demo showing reproducible results
- Comparison testing against ChatGPT/Claude/etc.

Press kit attached. Let me know if you're interested—I can make founder available for interview this week.

Thanks,

## ACADEMIC / RESEARCH OUTREACH

### François Chollet (ARC-AGI Creator)

**Subject:** ARC-AGI-2: 100% Accuracy Achievement - Seeking Verification

**Body:**

Dr. Chollet,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out because we've achieved results on ARC-AGI-2 that warrant your attention and, ideally, your verification.

**Results:**
- 400/400 tasks solved correctly
- 0.887 seconds total execution time
- Consistent reproducibility across test runs

**Approach:**
Our architecture differs fundamentally from conventional neural networks:
- No training on internet-scale data
- Local execution (Apple M3 Ultra)
- Five-pillar system optimized by golden ratio (φ = 1.618)
- Genuine abstraction mechanisms (not statistical correlation)

**Why I'm reaching out:**
As the creator of ARC-AGI, your verification would be invaluable. I recognize extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and I'm committed to rigorous examination.

**What I'm requesting:**
1. Independent testing opportunity
2. Your feedback on methodology
3. Suggestions for additional verification
4. Guidance on proper academic disclosure

**What I can provide:**
- Live demonstration (remote or in-person)
- Complete technical documentation
- Access for independent testing
- Full transparency on methods

I understand you're busy, but given the significance of perfect ARC-AGI-2 performance, I believe this warrants investigation.

Would you be available for a call to discuss?

Respectfully,
John Barreto
Founder, Prothean Systems
john@prothean.systems

**Note:** I'm treating these results with appropriate skepticism myself—which is precisely why I'm reaching out for rigorous verification before broader announcement.
