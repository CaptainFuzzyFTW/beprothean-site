# Prothean Emergent Intelligence - Emotional Soundtrack Guide

**Total Duration:** 25-30 minutes
**Style:** Cinematic, emotional, builds from tension to triumph
**Inspiration:** Hans Zimmer (Interstellar), Trent Reznor (Social Network), Max Richter (The Blue Notebooks)

## MUSICAL PHILOSOPHY

The soundtrack follows the golden ratio (φ = 1.618) in:
- Tempo relationships (slower sections to faster sections = 1:1.618)
- Dynamic build (quiet to loud follows φ curve)
- Harmonic progression (frequency ratios based on φ)
- Section lengths (act durations in φ proportions)

**Key:** C minor → C major (darkness to light)
**Core motif:** Three-note ascending pattern (C-D-E♭ in minor, C-D-E in major)
