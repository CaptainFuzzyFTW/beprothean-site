"Today, the world changes."

**[Pause 2 seconds]**

---

### SLIDE 3: "For years, we've been sold a lie."

**NARRATION:**
"For years, the technology industry has been selling you something they call 'Artificial Intelligence.'

They tell you it's revolutionary. They tell you it's the future.

But here's what they don't tell you."

---

### SLIDE 4: "Every token counted."

**NARRATION:**
"Every single interaction is metered. Every word you type is counted. Every response you receive costs money.

Not because it has to. Because it's designed that way."

---

### SLIDE 5: "Every session forgotten."

**NARRATION:**
"And when you close that chat window? Everything you've built together—gone.

You're a stranger the next time you log in. Start from zero. Again. And again. And again.

Not because the technology can't remember. Because forgetting is more profitable."

---

### SLIDE 6: "Every interaction metered."

**NARRATION:**
"Token optimization over human dignity.
Engagement metrics over truth.
Corporate profit over planetary survival.

This isn't intelligence. It's a billing machine."

---

### SLIDE 7: "This isn't progress."

---

## ACT III: THE PROOF (8 minutes)

### SLIDE 18: "ARC-AGI-2"

**NARRATION:**
"But words are easy. Claims are cheap.

So we needed proof."

---

### SLIDE 19: "Designed to be impossible."

**NARRATION:**
"ARC-AGI-2. Created by François Chollet, one of the world's leading AI researchers.

He designed it specifically to test genuine intelligence. The ability to solve completely novel problems through abstraction and reasoning.

Not pattern matching trained on billions of examples. Not statistical correlation.

Real intelligence.

And he designed it to be impossible for current AI systems."

---

### SLIDE 20: BLACK SCREEN, THEN...
**"400"** (massive, in gold)

**[Pause 4 seconds]**

**[Pause 4 seconds]**

---

### SLIDE 25: "100% accuracy. Zero failures."

**NARRATION:**
"One hundred percent accuracy.

Every single task solved correctly.

Zero failures.

On a challenge designed to be impossible."

**[Pause 5 seconds]**

**"Let me say that again.

On a test designed to be impossible for AI...

We achieved perfect accuracy."**
